## Route and Stops

After I-90 we turned off to the Yakima Canyon Highway or WA-821. It’s very scenic, and a road that FSD handles well. I highly recommend the route. It runs along the Yakima River, and is a National Recreation Area.

A quick lunch was had at the Canyon River Grill, which is also next to Red’s fly shop. Seems to be a hotspot for fly fishing here.

We saw a wildfire on the side of highway after Prosser, WA:

Planned charging on this route is a necessity, as Walla Walla is a DCFC desert (23kW is the fastest, and it’s CCS). So either charge up, bring a CCS adapter, or choose a destination with access to charging.

We stopped for a 15 minute break at the Kennewick Supercharger, and did the rest of the charging at Amavi Winery, and Walla Walla High School.

That's all for today. Time to hit the gym, get some rest, and head to Boise, ID tomorrow.
