This drive was done without a charging stop, as there are chargers at the Zion Lodge. The Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is exactly that, very scenic.

We started the day with 70% and made it to Zion with 49% remaining. We woke up early to catch the sunrise, and started our drive after that.

I will provide a stats update later on, but for now, just enjoy the timelapse above, and the pictures.

## Lodging and Charging

We stayed at Zion Lodge, which is excellent. Unfortunately the Wi-Fi there is worse than spotty, so the Starlink had to be brought out. There are two chargers, and not many people use them. We walked around the entire parking lot and found no other EVs, other than ours and the red 3 that used the other one. 7kW is great, however lack of cell signal means a more or less useless Tesla App.

Starlink worked surprisingly well, considering it was very obstructed with Trees and the lodge overhead. But it worked better than whatever internet was provided to the Zion Lodge, and I could even upload the above time lapse to YouTube.

Full day of Zion tomorrow
