Anything under $500 USD to Tokyo is considered a great deal. Under $400 and to Haneda is an amazing deal. Haneda is the airport closest to the city. Unlike Narita, it doesn’t involve a 90 minute train ride, and you’ll save around 3,000-4,000 JPY in transit costs to and from the airport.

_Airfare sales only last 24-48 hours and can disappear at anytime. If booking a US airline, take advantage of a 24 hour fee-free cancellation period._
