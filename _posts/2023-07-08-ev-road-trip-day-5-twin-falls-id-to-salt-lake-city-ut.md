We decided to take a detour in order to visit the Bonneville Salt Flats en route to SLC, instead of making an out-and-back trip after wards. Coincidentally, this was almost the prettiest of the drives so far.

## Crossing into Nevada

Going south directly from Twin Falls leads you through a lot of farmland, and eventually it turns into undeveloped federal land. You spend a lot of time in the 5000-6000 feet of elevation, and you can definitely feel it when you’re breathing, and your ears popping. These are not your typical mountain passes. You’re in high desert territory.

We stopped at Jackpot, NV to see if we could get some free CCS juice, but alas, no. We got a little bit of L2 during the bathroom break, and we went to the Wells Supercharger in Nevada. I thought everything being a casino was just a Las Vegas thing, but it appears that it’s a Nevada thing. Every border town… is a casino town.

After wells we headed out towards West Wendover, NV. The clouds made for some dramatic skies, and the landscape was expansive. The scenery really showed off the Model X’s windshield.

We did some off-roading to get to a viewpoint before arriving in Wendover. However I didn’t like how the rocks looked so we stopped and reversed out. Not in the mood to deal with a sidewall gash.

## Bonneville Salt Flats

No description is needed for this place. Pictures say it all.

I did try a 0-60 run, the road surface is surprisingly numb and smooth. After leaving the salt flats I drove to the nearest self serve car wash place and threw $10 into the machine and blasted as much salt away as I could. There are only a few traces remaining, a heavy rainstorm or another deep blast with a pressure washer should clear it. The Rallyarmor mud flaps did a great job of keeping the salt contained in the wheel wells.

## Towards Utah

We charged up at West Wendover before crossing into Utah towards Salt Lake City.

Interstate 80 after Wendover is straight and flat. You just cruise along at 80 for miles and miles, salt on your left and right. Once you leave the salt area, it’s just a short drive in more high desert until Salt Lake City.
