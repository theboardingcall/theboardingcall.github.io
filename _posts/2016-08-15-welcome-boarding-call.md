Until 2015, I haven’t left the country in over 15 years. Since then, I haven’t been back.

I’ve created tools to scrape the internet for airfare deals, shuffled credit card bonuses, and learned how to book award travel. Here, you’ll find the best of everything. From deals to insider tips.

Share my view from the window seat.
