description: "Day 11: Hiking Angel's Landing in Zion National Park, a 5.6-mile trail gaining 1,600 feet with chain-assisted sections."
---

We kept this day pretty low key because we managed to get a permit to hike Angel’s Landing, which is an insane hike that spans 5.6 miles and goes up 1600 feet. We wanted to leave the park and check out Springdale, but the line to get back in was too long for us to even consider it. So we drive the scenic drive again, but the light was too harsh at that time of day to take great photos.

However, something we learned is that everyone wants to crowd Angel’s Landing at sunrise and early in the day when it’s cooler. However, Sunset may be the best time to hike it, as the trail is shaded, and you can get great views at the time without the sun beating you down too hard.
