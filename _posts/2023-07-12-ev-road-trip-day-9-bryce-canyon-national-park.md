This is really going to be a photo post. But I wanted to point out a few things:

  * Charge up at Ruby’s Inn in Bryce Canyon City, they have 2x 4kW and 2x 8kW Tesla chargers.
  * Bryce Canyon is not a ‘scenic drive’.
  * Bryce Canyon is best at Sunrise, and is an amazing place to view the night sky. Sunset is underwhelming
  * The food at the lodge restaurant is surprising in a good way.
  * The Sunset lodge has fiber internet, which is also surprising. 250up/250down, maxing out the wifi.

The update for this day was delayed due to many things going on and prioritizing sleep. See you in Zion!
